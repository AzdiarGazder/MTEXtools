function split(inebsd,varargin)
%% Function description:
% Splits or sub-divides an ebsd map into a regular, rectangular matrix of 
% submaps with a user-specified number of rows and columns. Additional 
% inputs include the ability to overlap a length fraction along both, 
% horizontal and vertical submap directions. The submaps are returned to 
% the main MATLAB workspace as individual ebsd variables. The location of 
% each submap is denoted by the row and column number. 
% For example: ebsd23 = a submap from row 2, column 3 of the ebsd map.
%
%% Note to users:
% Gridify the sub-map variables before saving sub-maps as a *.ctf file.

%% Syntax:
%  [str] = split(ebsd)
%
%% Input:
%  ebsd       - @EBSD
%
%% Output:
%  str        - structure variable containing @EBSD
%
%% Options:
%  'matrix'            -  @numeric, a 1 x 2 array defining the number of 
%                         rows and columns to split the ebsd map into 
%                         submaps.
%  'overlap'           -  @numeric, a 1 x 2 array defining the factor 
%                         (ranging between 0.01 and 0.99) by which to 
%                         overlap subsets along the susbet maps along the 
%                         horizontal and vertical sub-map directions.

%% example of the logic used in the algorithm to split the map:

% Task =  Split 100 pixels into 4 columns such that:
% submap 1 = submap 1 + right overlap...
% submap 2 = left overlap + submap 2 + right overlap...
% submap 3 = left overlap + submap 3 + right overlap...
% submap 4 = left overlap + submap 4
%
% nominal column indices = [1 25 50 75 100]
% overlap = 5 pixels
%
% column indices defining the bounds for submap 1:
% left = 1
% right = 25 + 5 = 30
% size of submap 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 columns
%
% column indices defining the bounds for submap 2:
% left = 25 - 5 = 20
% right = 50 + 5 = 55
% size of submap 2 = 55 - 20 = 35 columns
%
% column indices defining the bounds for submap 3:
% left = 50 - 5 = 45
% right = 75 + 5 = 80
