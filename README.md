# mtexTools
A collection of various MTEX scripts and functions.

## A
- [**align**](https://github.com/AzdiarGazder/mtexTools/tree/main/align): Align ebsd map data along a user-specified linear fiducial in case of drift caused by the thermal cycling of scanning coil electronics during acquisition. The linear fiducial may correspond to a twin boundary, stacking fault, or any linear-shaped deformation or phase transformation products. Instructions on script use are provided in the window titlebar.

## C
- [**crop**](https://github.com/AzdiarGazder/mtexTools/tree/main/crop): Crop, cut-out or make a subset of ebsd map data from within a user-specified rectangular, circular, polygonal or freehand area-based region of interest (ROI). Instructions on script use are provided in the window titlebar.

## E
- [**euclideanDistance**](https://github.com/AzdiarGazder/mtexTools/tree/main/euclideanDistance): Calculates the 2D Euclidean distance in pixels (default) or map scan units for supported distance methods for each pixel within a grain.The default 2D Euclidean distance measurement is from the grain center to the grain boundary in pixels or map scan units. The 2D Euclidean distance measurement from the grain boundary to the grain center is available but only when specified by the user. The values are returned within the 'ebsd.prop.euclid' structure variable.

## S
- [**stitch**](https://github.com/AzdiarGazder/mtexTools/tree/main/stitch): Stitch, combine or merge two ebsd maps togther by defining a user-specified position (and offset) for map 2 relative to map 1.
