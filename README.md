# mtexTools
A collection of various MTEX scripts and functions.

## A
- [**align**](https://github.com/AzdiarGazder/mtexTools/tree/main/align): % Align ebsd map data along a user-specified linear fiducial in case of drift caused by the thermal cycling of scanning coil electronics during acquisition. The linear fiducial may correspond to a twin boundary, stacking fault, or any linear-shaped deformation or phase transformation products. Instructions on script use are provided in the window titlebar.

## C
- [**crop**](https://github.com/AzdiarGazder/mtexTools/tree/main/crop): Crop, cut-out or make a subset of ebsd map data from within a user-specified rectangular, circular, polygonal or freehand area-based region of interest (ROI). Instructions on script use are provided in the window titlebar.

## S
- [**stitch**](https://github.com/AzdiarGazder/mtexTools/tree/main/stitch): Stitch, combine or merge two ebsd maps togther by defining a user-specified position (and offset) for map 2 relative to map 1.
